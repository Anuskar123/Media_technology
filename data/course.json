Always verify installation with <em>python --version</em> and run a simple file to confirm the PATH is correct.<br><br><strong>Core Skills:</strong> Variables store values, and Python infers the type from assignment. Use input() to collect data (as text) and cast to int or float when you need numeric operations. Output cleanly with f-strings (e.g., f\"Name: {name}\").<br><br><strong>Operators:</strong> Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, //, %, **) and comparison (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) are the foundation for later control flow. Use parentheses to control precedence.<br><br><strong>Readability:</strong> Indentation is mandatory for code blocks. Comments should explain purpose or logic, not restate the obvious.
