          "deepNotes": "Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. When you write Python code, the Python interpreter reads it line by line and executes it. Variables are containers for storing data values. In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable - Python automatically determines it based on the value you assign. For example, x = 5 makes x an integer, while x = 'hello' makes x a string. The print() function is fundamental - it outputs text to the console. When combining strings and numbers in print(), you can use concatenation (joining strings with +) or formatting methods. Comments start with # and are ignored by Python, helping you document your code for others (and your future self) to understand."

Comparison operators like == (equal), != (not equal), < (less than) are used in conditions. Logical operators (and, or, not) let you combine multiple conditions. For loops iterate over sequences (lists, ranges), executing code multiple times with automatic counters. While loops keep executing as long as a condition is true - be careful of infinite loops! Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Parameters are inputs to functions, and return statements send results back to the caller. Variable scope determines where a variable can be accessed - local variables exist only within their function, while global variables exist throughout the program. This is crucial for writing maintainable code."

Lists are accessed by index starting from 0. Lists have many useful methods: append() adds items, remove() removes by value, pop() removes by index, sort() arranges items. Dictionaries are incredibly powerful - they store key-value pairs, allowing you to access data by meaningful keys (names) rather than numeric indices. For example, student['John'] can return John's grade. Tuples are like lists but immutable - once created, they can't be changed. This makes them useful for data that shouldn't be modified. Sets contain only unique values and are useful for eliminating duplicates. When choosing data structures, think about: Do I need order? Do I need to modify it? Do I need key-value pairs? Do I need unique values? Understanding these structures is essential for writing efficient Python code."

Resolution describes the image dimensions (e.g., 1920x1080 means 1920 pixels wide, 1080 pixels tall). DPI (dots per inch) and PPI (pixels per inch) measure density - higher values mean more detail but larger files. Image formats are stored as files: JPEG uses lossy compression (some data lost but smaller file), PNG uses lossless compression (no data lost but larger file), GIF supports animation. Color depth (measured in bits) determines how many colors can be represented: 8-bit = 256 colors, 24-bit = 16 million colors. Understanding these concepts is foundational to image processing."

          "deepNotes": "RGB is the additive color model - it works by combining light (used in screens). R=255, G=255, B=255 creates white (all light), R=0, G=0, B=0 creates black (no light). Each color channel is typically 8 bits (0-255), so there are 256^3 = 16 million possible colors in 24-bit RGB. HSV (Hue-Saturation-Value) is more intuitive for humans: Hue is the actual color (0-360 degrees), Saturation is color intensity (0-100%), Value is brightness. CMYK is subtractive (ink on paper) and is complementary to RGB - it's used for printing. Grayscale represents images in shades of gray (0=black to 255=white), often created by averaging or weighting RGB values. Understanding multiple color models is essential for different applications - RGB for screens, CMYK for printing, HSV for intuitive editing."

Contrast adjustment multiplies RGB values, making light areas lighter and dark areas darker. Filters like blur work through convolution - a mathematical operation that applies a kernel (small matrix) to each pixel and its neighbors. Blur averages surrounding pixels making images softer. Sharpen emphasizes differences making edges crisp. Edge detection filters highlight boundaries between objects. Histograms show the distribution of pixel values - histogram equalization spreads values across the full range to improve contrast. Compression reduces file size: lossy (like JPEG) removes details humans can't notice easily, lossless (like PNG) preserves all data. Noise appears as random pixels, often from camera sensors; noise reduction (like Gaussian blur) smooths it. Image segmentation divides images into meaningful regions. All these techniques are used in medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, and photo editing software."

We perceive color through signals from these cones to the brain. Color blindness occurs when one or more cone types don't function properly. Red-green color blindness (most common, 8% of males) means reduced sensitivity to red and green. Complete color blindness (monochromacy) means seeing only in grayscale, extremely rare. When designing, avoid relying solely on color to convey information. Use patterns, shapes, or text labels alongside colors. Metamerism is interesting - two different wavelength combinations can appear identical if they stimulate the same combination of cones. This is how color displays work with just RGB. Afterimages occur because viewing a color fatigues those specific cones; when you look away, the unstimulated cones respond, creating the opposite color."

HSV (Hue-Saturation-Value) and HSL (Hue-Saturation-Lightness) are cylindrical representations of RGB, more intuitive for human color selection but still device-dependent. LAB is truly device-independent - it's based on human color perception. L represents Lightness (0-100), A represents green-red spectrum, B represents blue-yellow spectrum. LAB is useful for color difference calculations because similar distances in LAB space represent similar perceptual differences. XYZ is based on CIE standard observer (average human eye) and is the foundation for many modern color spaces. Color gamut is the range of colors a device can produce - monitors have larger gamuts than printers. ICC profiles bridge this gap by translating colors between spaces, crucial for professional work. Conversion between spaces involves matrix transformations - complex mathematics that software handles for you."

A typical photography workflow: capture in RAW (maximum data), develop in a wide-gamut space, edit using ICC profiles, proof on calibrated monitors, output to specific device profiles. Soft proofing shows on-screen how an image will look when printed - it uses ICC profiles to simulate the printer's color space. Display calibration using tools like colorimeter ensures your monitor accurately displays colors - critical for professional work. Color harmony helps create visually pleasing combinations: complementary colors are opposite on the color wheel (high contrast), analogous colors are adjacent (harmonious), triadic uses three evenly spaced colors. Color psychology: warm colors (red, orange, yellow) evoke energy and excitement; cool colors (blue, green) evoke calm and trust; warm colors advance visually while cool colors recede. For data visualization, using sequential color schemes (light to dark) works for ordered data, diverging schemes for data with meaningful midpoint. Viridis and similar perceptually uniform colormaps are colorblind-friendly alternatives to rainbow colormaps. Brand color consistency requires managing exact specifications (Pantone numbers, RGB values, CMYK values) for all media to maintain brand recognition."

Storage can be interleaved (RGBRGBRGB...) or planar (all R values, then all G values, then all B values). Bytes per pixel in RGB is 3 (1 byte per channel); with alpha it's 4. Indexed color uses a color palette - each pixel stores an index (0-255) pointing to a color in the palette. This saves space but limits colors to 256. Direct color stores the actual RGB values. The alpha channel (A) is sometimes added as a fourth channel for transparency (0=fully transparent, 255=fully opaque). Some formats like GIF support transparency, while basic JPEG doesn't. Understanding storage representation is crucial for efficient image processing and compression."

          "deepNotes": "Color adjustments operate on individual channels. Brightness adjustment adds a constant to all RGB values uniformly. Contrast stretches the range of values (values < 128 become darker, > 128 become lighter). White balance corrects for different light sources - cool (blue) light requires reducing blue and/or boosting red to look natural. Color cast appears when one color dominates - often fixed by adjusting that channel. Hue rotation shifts all colors around the color wheel equally. Saturation adjustment multiplies the distance of each pixel from the grayscale center - increasing saturation makes colors more vivid. Selective color adjustment isolates specific color ranges (e.g., only reds) and adjusts them independently, powerful for subtle corrections. Channel swaps (swap R with B) create artistic effects. Gamma correction is nonlinear brightness adjustment following human perception (we're more sensitive to shadow details). Color inversion (each channel becomes 255-value) creates negative effects. Understanding these operations is essential for professional image editing and computational color correction."

          "deepNotes": "Color-based segmentation identifies pixels within a specific color range - useful for separating objects by color. Chroma key (green screen) is color-based segmentation where pixels matching the key color (usually green or blue) are replaced with a background. It requires careful edge handling to avoid color fringing. Color clustering groups similar colors together - useful for color quantization (reducing number of colors) and object detection. In-painting restores missing or damaged color information by interpolating from surrounding pixels. Demosaicing is crucial - digital camera sensors have a Bayer pattern (alternating red, green, blue pixels) instead of full color at each pixel. Sophisticated algorithms interpolate missing color channels at each pixel. RAW processing uses demosaicing to create full RGB images. Color-space optimization chooses the best space for specific operations - HSV is better for color-based tasks, LAB for perceptually uniform operations, RGB for most algorithms. Color stereo uses color information for 3D reconstruction in addition to intensity. Computational color correction automatically adjusts colors using machine learning or mathematical models. These advanced techniques power modern computational photography, medical imaging, and video production."
